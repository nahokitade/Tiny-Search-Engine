README for query

Author: Naho Kitade

query is a part 3 of the Tiny Search Engine project. The query will take the outputs from indexer and crawler to process a query from the user using OR and AND operators. This is the user interface part of the TSE. 

Building:
query can be built using the Makefile included in the submission. Cammand make will automatically update and make the query executable.
The Makefile in the test directory will make all unit tests.

Command Input

./query [INDEXER OUTPUT FILE] [CRAWLER OUTPUT FILE DIRECTORY]

Example command input: 

./query ./index.dat ./WebPageDir

[INDEXER OUTPUT FILE] ./index.dat 
file that is the output of indexer

[CRAWLER OUTPUT FILE DIRECTORY] ./WebPageDir
Directory that contains the output from crawler

Assumptions:
1) There is enough memory to run query (ie space for all the memory allocations of data structures and words stored during execution.)
2) Query will fail with a return of 0 if there is not enough space to build the inverted index.
3) Query will print results in color according to their rank.
4) The caller has the write and read permission for the files inputted to query.
5) The crawler directory passed to the indexer will in fact contain the files outputted by crawler.
6) The first line of the crawler output has the URL.
