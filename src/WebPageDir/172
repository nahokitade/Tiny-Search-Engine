<H2>Some EDSAC statistics</H2>

<h3>Executive summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>650 instructions per second.
<li>1024 17-bit words of memory in mercury ultrasonic delay lines.
<li>Paper tape input and teleprinter output at 6 2/3 characters per second.

<li>3000 valves, 12 kW power consumption, occupied a room 5m by 4m.

<li>"Operating system" occupied 31 words of read-only memory.

<li>Early use to solve problems in meteorology, genetics and X-ray 
crystallography.

<li>First book on programming by Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill published in 1951.

<li>Magnetic tape backing store added in 1952 (but never worked really well).

<li>First course in Computer Science started in 1953, using the EDSAC.
</ul>

<h3>Some more details</h3>

<p>
"The EDSAC (electronic delay storage automatic calculator) is a serial 
electronic calculating machine working in the scale of two and using 
ultrasonic tanks for storage.  The main store consists of 32 tanks, each 
of which is about 5 ft long and holds 32 numbers of 17 binary digits, one 
being a sign digit.  This gives 1024 storage locations in all.  It is 
possible to run two adjacent storage locations together so as to 
accommodate a number with 35 binary digits (including a sign digit);  thus 
at any time the store may contain a mixture of long and short numbers.  
Short tanks which can hold one number only are used for accumulator and 
multiplier registers in the arithmetical unit, and for control purposes in 
various parts of the machine."
[Paper by Wilkes &amp; Renwick in 1, reprinted in 2]

<p>
The EDSAC contained some 3000 valves arranged in 12 racks and consumed 
about 12Kw of power.  The delay lines (or "tanks") were arranged in two 
batteries providing 512 words each.  The second battery came into 
operation in 1952.  [3]

<p>
Input was on 5-track teleprinter paper tape via an electromechanical tape 
reader running at 6 2/3 characters per second.  It was replaced by an 
improved version running at 16 char/sec in October 1949 and by a 
photoelectric reader running at 50 char/sec in early 1950.  Output was 
delivered via a teleprinter at 6 2/3 char/sec.  An output paper tape punch 
running at 16 char/sec was added in 1951.  [3]

<p>
Magnetic tape storage was added in 1952 (but never worked sufficiently well to be of real use).  [4]

<p>
The machine ran at 500kHz.  Wilkes notes that he would have been happy to 
accept the challenge of working at 1MHz (as most other early designers 
were doing) but preferred a straightforward development to permit early 
experiments with the writing of programs to solve real problems.  [5]

<p>
Instructions occupied a single 17-bit word but the whole delay line had to 
circulate before the next instruction could be executed, so the fastest 
that consecutive instructions could be executed was 500,000/((32+1).(17+1)) = 841 instructions per second.  Average order times were 
1.5ms (say 650 instructions per second), with a multiplication in 4.5ms. 
Division in software took about 200 ms.  [3]

<p>
The operating system or "initial orders" consisted of 31 instructions 
which were hard-wired on uniselectors, a mechanical read-only memory.  
These instructions assembled programs in symbolic form from paper tape 
into the main memory and set them running.  The second release of the 
initial orders was installed in August 1949.  This occupied the full 41 
words of read-only memory and included facilities for relocation or 
"coordination" to facilitate the use of subroutines (an important 
invention by D.J. Wheeler).  [3]

<p>
Interest in programming methodology (as it would now be called) did not 
prevent the active use of EDSAC for solving genuine problems.  One of the 
earliest of these was proposed by R.A. Fisher - the solution of a second 
order non-linear differential equation with two point boundary conditions. 
It was solved by D.J. Wheeler by April 1950 and was published with due 
acknowledgements later in the year in Biometrics, making some progress 
towards establishing the credibility of electronic computing.  The first 
publication of results from EDSAC was in R.S. Scorer's note on a 
meteorological problem published in the Quarterly Journal of Mechanics 
early in 1950.  This used a modification of M.V. Wilkes' program to 
compute values of Airy's integral.  [5]

<p>
<i>The preparation of programs for an electronic digital computer</i> by M.V. Wilkes, D.J. Wheeler and S. Gill (the first book on programming) was 
published by Addison-Wesley in 1951.  A film was made at the same time 
showing the EDSAC in use.  [4]

<p>
The Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing (now the Diploma 
in Computer Science) began.  This was a one-year postgraduate course, the 
first formal course leading to a university qualification in computing 
anywhere in the world.  [4]

<p>
From 1953 the EDSAC was heavily used for (among other subjects) 
theoretical chemistry under S.F. Boys;  X-ray molecular biology by J.C. 
Kendrew;  numerical analysis by D.R. Hartree and J.C.P. Miller;  
atmospheric oscillations by Wilkes;  early work on radioastronomy (much 
extended on EDSAC 2) by group under M.F. Ryle.  [4]

<p>
M.V. Wilkes' paper, <i>On the best way to design an automatic calculating 
machine</i>, introduced the ideas of microprogramming and bit-slicing for the 
design of the EDSAC 2 in 1951.  [4]
